# 42sh
A public and debugged version of my Epitech school project 42sh.
You can find the original subject [here](./docs/42sh_subject.pdf).
## Goal
This is one of the end of year project in the first year of PGE cursus at Epitech, in the module Shell Programing. The goal of this project is to reproduce a TCSH shell in C, following certain constraints.

For the sake of cleaning the code and publishing a clean project, some constraints have been lifted, such as the usage of certains function of the standard library, or few coding style constraints.

## Installation
> Make sure to have [gcc] (https://gcc.gnu.org/) and [make] (https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) installed (make comes often included with gcc in most packages).
```
git clone git@github.com:ThomasGireaudot/42sh.git
```

## Usage
Compile with :
```
make
```

Run with (under linux) :
```
./42sh
```
